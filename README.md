# BOOMBIKES Bike Sharing Assignment

## Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demand.

## Assignment Goal

To build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## Business Goal

1. The developed model will be used by company management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
2. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
